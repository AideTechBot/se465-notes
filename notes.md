#### Fault

#### Error

#### Failure

Train track example:

```
-----------
|||||||||||
--------------------------
           |||||||||||||||
           ---------------
```
This track is an example of a fault, no train has passed yet. Nothing bad has happened

If there is a train, there is an error, it is in a bad state, but nothing bad has happened

If the train derails, that is a failure.

**Causes:**
- Poor design
- Mechanical stresses (eg. earthquake)
